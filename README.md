Step Man (Game/Step Counter)

-A step counter that also acts as a game!

On first startup, there is a login activity where you enter a name that will you have for the rest of the time you play the game, unless you delete it. 

Afterwards you will be brought to a profile activity that will welcome you with the name you provided in another activity, and also keep track of your steps and level. You can shut down the app and it will remember your name, steps, and level. 

The features are very limited as of now, but the core functionality is happily working.
